1) Try MRCC and MOLPRO at 7.88015737237411  Bohr to see what happens, since this is where CFOUR's calculation was.
2) Try CFOUR from scratch (not with a saved integral file)
3) Why does the CCSD for CFOUR say scftol=16 when the ROHF is scftol=10? Can we get the scftol=16 results from that output file?
